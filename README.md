# frotz
Frotz is an open-source Z-machine (Infocom) interactive text game interpreter.

This project is a direct fork of FROTZ V2.44 found on SourceForge with only code cleanup and debugging changes.
This supports only the curses and dumb terminal versions, if you need Sound and Graphics enhanced versions (SDL),
please consider the master branch now found and maintined at https://gitlab.com/DavidGriffith/frotz

The original Zork (and other Infocom games) source code has now been released and can now be found at
https://github.com/historicalsource/zork1
but unless you have access to computers and compilers from the late 1970's, good luck getting these versions running.

Releases of the original mainframe Dungeon and Adventure games are out there as well.

There's a great overview of the history of Zork software development on YouTube here...

Downloads of the original software binaries are many places on the web. To use Frotz you'll need a copy of ZORK.DAT.
Here's one where you can get copies of the original Zork triligy

To build, git clone or download and unpack zip, then "make". Both frotz and dfrotz for curses or dumb terminal versions respectivly will then be in the build directory.

Watch out for Grues.
